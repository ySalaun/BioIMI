  TITLE={Use of the Hough Transformation to Detect Lines and Curves in Pictures},
  ADDRESS={333 Ravenswood Ave, Menlo Park, CA 94025},
  INSTITUTION={AI Center, SRI International},
  MONTH={Apr},
  NUMBER={36},
  YEAR={1971},
  KEYWORDS={Image processing, Picture processing, Pattern recognition, Line detection;

  ABSTRACT={Hough has proposed an interesting and computationally efficient procedure
     for detecting lines in pictures. In this paper we point out that the use of
     angle-radius rather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation
     further. We also show how the method can be used for more general curve fitting,
     and give alternative interpretations that explain the source of its efficiency.
